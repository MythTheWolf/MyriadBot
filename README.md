# Modbot

The last discord bot you'll ever need!

## Why modbot?
Modbot is different from other bots! Here's how:
 * It's not a stock-feature bot. It's really a backend program.
 * It runs on plugins, not hard-coded features.
 
**Wait, plugins?**
Yep, plugins! Much like spigot/craftbukkit, developers can use modbot's API to write plugins
Developers, this means all the hard work is done for you! With the built in API you can:
  * Register Commands, with custom set syntax
  * Listen for events
  * Use the native Javacord API
